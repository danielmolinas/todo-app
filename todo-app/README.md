# Todo App

The Todo App is a simple project using React and Vite. This allows the user to enter their tasks, which is then divided into 3 tabs:

- **All**
- **Open**
- **Complete**

## All

Displays all tasks, whether completed or still open.

## Open

Contains tasks that are still not marked as completed.

## Completed

Contains all the completed tasks.
